#Inline javascript plotting for IPython notebooks 

This package adds the ability to plot in an ipython notebook using the flot plotting backend. This makes it possible to have interactive (zoomable) plots within an ipython notebook webpage. The flot javascript library that is sourced is currently hosted at crbates.github.com/flot/. This add-in requires ipython >= 0.13
